    "    1. 「作業二是延續作業一的」\n",
    "        作業一是讓大家做tokenize，作業二就是要讓大家練習計算token的tf、\n",
    "        df，所以tokenize部分大家可以直接拿作業一的code來用，當然，如果覺\n",
    "        得之前寫的不好想再修改也是都可以的。\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. 「沒有明顯stopword殘留，符合要求的輸出格式，基本上就是滿分」\n",
    "        作業二也是沒有標準答案的，因為大家切出的token不同，後續計算出的\n",
    "        tf、df當然也就不同了。\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. 「作業一沒有套件限制，但作業二有！！！」\n",
    "        如前所說，這次作業主要是讓大家練習計算token的tf、df，所以計算tf、\n",
    "        df這部分請一定要自己寫，不要用現成的套件，ex：sklearn，但是計算\n",
    "        cosine用一些向量計算的套件是ok的，如:numpy、scipy。\n",
    "\n",
    "- 繳交格式\n",
    "    1. 「記得有四個檔要交！」\n",
    "        如老師的作業說明所說，記得要交dictionary、vector file of document 1、\n",
    "        source code、report。\n",
    "    2. 「report格式請交pdf！」\n",
    "        report內容要求如作業一，關於處理邏輯部分，你可以寫出你使用哪一種\n",
    "        smoothing方法，如果處理過程中有什麼疑問也都可以記錄下來。\n",

    "- 一些小討論\n",
    "\n",
    "    有些同學對於要不要做stemming，標點符號、數字等等要不要移除有所疑\n",
    "    問，覺得stemming之後的字看起來怪怪的，或是認為標點符號也很重要不\n",
    "    應該移除，但其實基本上這是沒有標準的，可能隨你要做的任務、要處理\n",
    "    的資料不同而有所不同，一切都要靠實驗，用結果來決定，比如說假設要\n",
    "    做新聞分類模型，那就試試看移不移除數字哪個模型結果比較好。\n",
    "\n",
    "    另外，我們做這些處理，一方面是希望移除雜訊，另一方面也是希望減少\n",
    "    token數量，增加計算效能，這是一個trade off的問題，比如說stemming\n",
    "    採用暴力切尾法，可能把authoritys切成author，兩個字的意思雖然不盡相\n",
    "    同，但如果對分類結果影響不大(看你的分類問題對這兩字的差異敏不敏\n",
    "    感)，那我們可能還是會選擇做。\n",
    "\n",
    "    不過，因為我們作業的目的就是要讓大家練習上課提到的技巧，所以希望\n",
    "    大家各種技巧都能夠實作看看！\n",
    "\n",
    "- 重要的是對每個東西的前處理方式都要一樣\n",
    "- 排序好 ID 可以用 O(n) 去算 cosine 值"
